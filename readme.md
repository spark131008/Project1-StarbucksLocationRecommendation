# Project 1
- **[Question #2]** - What are the top 3 recommended **Starbucks** stores that are geographically the most accessible to me, based on the analysis of my driving data from 11/23/2020 to 12/31/2020 <br /> <br />
    - **[Step 1]** - Show the most appeared 5 addresses in my GPSTracking.csv file using a map/reduce program. <br /> <br />
    - **[Step 2]** - Show Starbucks stores that are only located in the same city and state as in the addresses from [Step 1].

    - **[Step 3]** - Use Google's Distance Matrix API to compute travel distances between 5 addresses from [Step 1] and each Starbucks store location from [Step 2]. [Google Map's Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start) <br /> <br />
    - **[Step 4]** - Use a simple algorithm to decide top 3 Starbucks stores that are most accessible to me. [Separate Repo for Starbucks Near Me Recommendation App](https://github.com/spark131008/Project1-StarbucksLocationRecommendation) <br /> <br />
